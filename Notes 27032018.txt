what is Maven:

migration for dependency, dealing with version, downloading the jar files, example twitter.jar

In Maven then is a config(pom.xml) we need to give which jar file you need to download, maven will download.

Maven will read the pom.xml file and use the information to download. Always update pom.xml when you need latest jar files need to be download
